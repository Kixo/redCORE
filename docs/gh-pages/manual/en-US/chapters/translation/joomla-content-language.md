## Creating Content Languages in Joomla

Before you can translate any content you will have to specify in Joomla witch are the available languages.

### Step 1
Go to `Extensiosn -> Language Manager`:

<img src="./assets/img/translation/07.png" class="example" />

### Step 2
Install the language that you want to use:

<img src="./assets/img/translation/09.png" class="example" />

### Step 3
Find the language, check it and install it, as we do in the following example where we are installing Spanish:

<img src="./assets/img/translation/10.png" class="example" />

What you have installed is just a set of Joomla basic words already translated to your language that will be used for Joomla itself, for example the common words used at the buttons of the toolbar: save, save adn close, publish / unpublish, etc.

Once your new language is available in the system you will have to set up a Content Languag### Step e
The 'Content language' screen is the place in Joomla were you define how and witch languages will be your content translated to.

So next you need to create the newly installed language as Content language.

### Step 4
In the Language Manager, Click `Content`:

<img src="./assets/img/translation/08.png" class="example" />

### Step 5
Then click `New`:

<img src="./assets/img/translation/11.png" class="example" />

### Step 6
And fill the form according to the language specifications (you can hover on each field title to have a brief explanation about the configuration you need to add):

<img src="./assets/img/translation/12.png" class="example" />

### Step 7
Once you `Save & Close`, you will be able to see a second language in your `Content languages` list:

<img src="./assets/img/translation/13.png" class="example" />
